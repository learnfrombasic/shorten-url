### **Shorten-URL: A Simple & Efficient URL Shortener** 🚀  

## **🔗 Introduction**  
Ever needed to share a long, clunky URL but wished it was **shorter and cleaner**? That’s exactly what **Shorten-URL** does! This service **shrinks long links** into compact, easy-to-share URLs while also enabling **tracking and customization**.  

While shortened links are great for **social media, messaging, and marketing**, they can also be misused to mask malicious sites. To prevent abuse, some platforms **block unknown short URLs**, but when used responsibly, they remain a **powerful tool for businesses and individuals alike**.
